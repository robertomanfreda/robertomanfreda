### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm interested in open-source, hacking, infosec, electronics, 3D printing.  
Check out [my personal blog](https://robertomanfreda.github.io) ("empty" for now).

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and GoLang.  
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: robertomanfreda1994@gmail.com || robertomanfreda@protonmail.com

I always try to write innovative software, so if we want to collaborate we do something special. Out of the core.
